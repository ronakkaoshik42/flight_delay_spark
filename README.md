# PySpark Machine Learning Analysis
ECE219 Project 1 - Large Scale Data Mining

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive example of using PySpark for machine learning. We compare the performance of various machine learning models on a flight delay prediction task. The analysis covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a step-by-step analysis using PySpark for machine learning. The goal is to predict flight delays based on various features. We explore data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run the code and analysis in this repository, you need:

- Python 3.x
- PySpark
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
